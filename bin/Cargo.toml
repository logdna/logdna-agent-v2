# version bump checklist
# 1) version = "X.Y.Z" in this file
#       ../bin/Cargo.toml
# 2) version in all the k8s yaml image: logdna/logdna-agent-v2:X.Y.Z
#       ../k8s/*.yaml
# 3) update changelog
#       ../CHANGELOG.md
# 4) *optional* run 'cargo update' so that new deps are pulled in
# 5) once the diff/pr is accepted tag the commit in master X.Y.Z, this will trigger the CI job
